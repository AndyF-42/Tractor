# Tractor

Tractor, also known as [Sheng-Ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji) is a point-based trick-taking card game popular in China. I was taught a version of it from a friend who has since created a blogpost detailing the rules of the game [here](https://shadowwolf37.blogspot.com/2023/09/tractor-rules.html).
